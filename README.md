## About
This keyboard is designed to be used by legs the idea came from my colleague, Aleksandr. It can be usefull in working with different kind of programs (3D designing for example). I created this project on the base of Arduino nano so that's why I need a python program running on PC to really control the keyboard with this microcontroller.

## Design
I created the model just for testing but probably I won't change it. The assembly is really easy, you need 3 buttons, 1 Arduino Nano, and some cable to connect them together.

## Schematics
This is the way how you can connect the buttons to the board. I use in arduino code INPUT_PULLUP so I need to connect just 3 pins to the buttons and the another legs to the GND.
